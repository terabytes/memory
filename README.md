## Description

This is a browser-based card matching game (sometimes known as Concentration) that tests your memory recall by using a timer, move counter, and star rating.

The board consists of 16 "cards" organized in a grid of 4 by 4. This "deck" of cards consists of 8 pairs. The cards are randomly placed in the grid with their symbols hidden. Flip over two cards at a time to find matches. Once all matches are found, you win!

## Dependencies
This project uses HTML, CSS, JS, Font Awesome, animate.css, and Google Fonts

## Technical Feats
* A JavaScript timer to track time elapsed
* Event listeners to detect click events
* DOM manipulation

## Getting Started

To get started on this project, begin by opening the `index.html` file to understand the structure of the page. Most, if not all, of the game logic resides in `js/app.js`.
